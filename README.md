Abstract : 
Electronic Know Your Customer (E-KYC) system designed to streamline identity verification processes using advanced computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR) technologies. The proposed system integrates face extraction and comparison modules to validate user identities by matching uploaded images against existing records, ensuring accuracy and preventing duplicate registrations. An OCR engine, coupled with preprocessor and postprocessor components, is employed to extract and verify textual information from identity documents. The system addresses critical challenges in digital onboarding, such as fraud detection and user authentication, while enhancing efficiency and compliance with regulatory standards. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize secure and scalable identity verification solutions.

Introdution :
In an era of rapid digital transformation, reliable identity verification has become a cornerstone for financial institutions, government services, and online platforms. Traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, which rely on manual document checks and in-person verification, are increasingly inadequate due to their inefficiency, high costs, and vulnerability to human error and fraud.  As a result, the need for them to physically visit a retail store or department to verify their identity can lead to cart abandonment or the loss of transactions to competitors who can meet their expectations. There is a need for updated KYC guidelines and regulations to align with the evolving nature of virtual transactions. It is feasible to make modifications to laws in order to enhance their applicability. Numerous countries have implemented e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) regulations to address the demands of the digital and landscape prevalent in contemporary times.

 A comprehensive E-KYC framework that integrates face recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), and automated decision-making to streamline the identity verification process. The system captures and extracts facial biometrics from government-issued ID cards, compares them with live user-submitted images, and validates textual data (e.g., name, ID number, and date of birth) through OCR. A key innovation of this approach is its real-time duplicate detection mechanism, which cross-references new registrations with an existing database to prevent identity fraud.

The proposed system consists of three core components:
1.	Biometric Verification Module – Utilizes deep learning-based face detection and matching to ensure the authenticity of the user.
2.	Document Processing Module – Employs OCR with preprocessing and postprocessing techniques to accurately extract and validate ID card information.
3.	Fraud Detection Module – Checks for duplicate or suspicious registrations, enhancing security and compliance.
 
By automating identity verification, this E-KYC system significantly reduces processing time, operational costs, and fraud risks while improving user experience. The study evaluates the system’s accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its applicability in banking, telecommunications, and e-governance. Future enhancements may include liveness detection to counter spoofing attacks and blockchain integration for decentralized identity management.

This project contributes to the advancement of secure, scalable, and AI-driven KYC solutions, paving the way for a more trustworthy and efficient digital ecosystem.
